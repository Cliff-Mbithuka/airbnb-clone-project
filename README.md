## Database Design

The database is designed using a relational model to ensure data integrity and enable complex relationships between entities. Below are the core entities and their attributes:

### Users
Represents both guests and hosts on the platform.
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Full name of the user
- `email`: Email address (unique)
- `password_hash`: Securely stored password
- `is_host`: Boolean indicating whether the user is a host

### Properties
Represents accommodations listed by hosts.
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `title`: Title of the property listing
- `description`: Detailed description of the property
- `location`: Address or geographic location
- `host_id`: Foreign key referencing the User who owns the property

### Bookings
Represents a reservation made by a user for a property.
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `user_id`: Foreign key referencing the guest (User)
- `property_id`: Foreign key referencing the booked property
- `check_in`: Date of check-in
- `check_out`: Date of check-out

### Payments
Represents payment transactions for bookings.
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `booking_id`: Foreign key referencing the related booking
- `amount`: Total amount paid
- `payment_method`: e.g., credit card, PayPal
- `payment_status`: e.g., paid, pending, failed

### Reviews
Represents user feedback for properties after a stay.
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `user_id`: Foreign key referencing the reviewer (User)
- `property_id`: Foreign key referencing the reviewed property
- `rating`: Numeric rating (e.g., 1â€“5)
- `comment`: Text review

### Entity Relationships
- A **User** can create multiple **Properties** (if they are a host).
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings**.
- Each **Booking** is linked to one **Property** and one **User**.
- Each **Booking** has one **Payment**.
- A **User** can leave multiple **Reviews**, each tied to a specific **Property**.

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
This feature allows users to register, authenticate, and manage their profiles. It ensures secure login and password management, enabling both guests and hosts to interact with the platform effectively. The authentication system is built with security best practices to safeguard user data.

### Property Management
Hosts can create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings. This feature enables them to add important details such as location, description, and pricing, providing a seamless experience for hosts to showcase their properties. Guests can easily browse available properties.

### Booking System
The booking system allows users to make, update, and manage bookings for properties. It tracks essential details such as check-in and check-out dates, ensuring users can reserve their stays seamlessly. It also ensures availability and prevents double-booking by integrating with the property database.

### Payment Processing
This feature handles transactions for bookings, including payment collection and status updates. It integrates with a payment gateway to securely process credit card or alternative payments. Payments are linked directly to bookings, and the system can manage various payment statuses (e.g., pending, successful).

### Review System
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties after their stay. This feature helps build trust within the platform, as potential guests can evaluate the property based on previous users' experiences. Reviews include both numerical ratings and detailed comments.

### Database Optimizations
The database is optimized for high performance and scalability. Caching and indexing strategies are implemented to speed up data retrieval, ensuring the platform can handle large volumes of users, properties, and bookings without slowdowns.

## API Security

Ensuring the security of backend APIs is crucial to protecting sensitive data, ensuring trust, and safeguarding against malicious activity. Below are the key security measures that will be implemented:

### Authentication
**Description**: Users will authenticate via a secure login system, typically using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth 2.0 for managing sessions. This ensures that only authorized users can access their data and interact with the platform.
**Why It's Crucial**: Protecting user accounts and ensuring only authenticated users can access sensitive data is fundamental to maintaining privacy and trust on the platform.

### Authorization
**Description**: Role-based authorization will be implemented to ensure that users and hosts only have access to the resources they are authorized to use. For example, guests cannot modify property listings, and only hosts can manage their properties.
**Why It's Crucial**: Authorization prevents unauthorized access and protects against data manipulation by ensuring that users can only perform actions within their allowed scope.

### Rate Limiting
**Description**: To prevent abuse and mitigate denial-of-service attacks, rate limiting will be implemented. This restricts the number of requests a user can make in a given time period.
**Why It's Crucial**: Rate limiting helps to prevent API overloads, ensuring the service remains stable and available to legitimate users. It also protects against brute-force attacks.

### Data Encryption
**Description**: Sensitive data, such as user passwords and payment details, will be encrypted using industry-standard algorithms (e.g., bcrypt for passwords, HTTPS for secure communication).
**Why It's Crucial**: Encrypting data ensures that even if the system is compromised, sensitive information remains protected from unauthorized access.

### Payment Security
**Description**: Payments will be processed using secure, third-party payment gateways that comply with PCI-DSS standards. Card details and transaction data will never be stored in the platformâ€™s database.
**Why It's Crucial**: Payment data is highly sensitive, and securing these transactions ensures users' financial information is protected, fostering trust and compliance with legal standards.

### Regular Security Audits
**Description**: The system will undergo regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities and ensure that security best practices are consistently followed.
**Why It's Crucial**: Continuous monitoring and auditing are vital to maintaining a secure environment, ensuring that potential risks are addressed before they can be exploited.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It is a set of modern software development practices that automate the process of code integration, testing, and deployment. The goal is to streamline the development workflow, improve code quality, and ensure faster delivery of features and fixes.

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Developers regularly merge code changes into a central repository, where automated tests are run to ensure that new code does not break existing functionality.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Once the code passes the tests, it is automatically deployed to the production environment, ensuring that the latest version of the application is always live.

### Why CI/CD is Important for the Airbnb Clone Project
- **Faster Development Cycle**: Automating the build, test, and deployment process speeds up development, allowing for quicker release of features and bug fixes.
- **Improved Code Quality**: Automated testing ensures that errors are caught early in the development process, reducing the chances of bugs in production.
- **Consistency**: With automated deployment, every change follows the same process, reducing the likelihood of human error and ensuring consistency across different environments (development, staging, production).
- **Scalability**: CI/CD pipelines allow the project to scale more easily by ensuring that the codebase remains stable as more features and updates are added.

### Tools for CI/CD
- **GitHub Actions**: A CI/CD tool integrated with GitHub that automates the testing, building, and deployment processes. GitHub Actions enables continuous integration by running automated workflows triggered by code changes.
- **Docker**: Used for containerizing the application and its dependencies, ensuring a consistent environment across development, staging, and production.
- **Heroku / AWS / DigitalOcean**: Cloud platforms where the backend services can be deployed. These platforms can be configured to automatically deploy the latest changes when the CI/CD pipeline completes.
- **CircleCI / Jenkins**: Alternatives to GitHub Actions that can also be used to automate the pipeline.
